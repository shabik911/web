        <h2 class="info">A hot stone massage is a type of massage therapy. 
            Itâ€™s used to help you relax and ease tense muscles
            and damaged soft tissues throughout your body.

            During a hot stone massage, smooth,
            flat, heated stones are placed on 
            specific parts of your body.
            The stones are usually made of basalt,
            a type of volcanic rock that retains heat.
            According to the University of New Hampshire
            Health Services, hot massage stones are heated
            to between 130 and 145 degrees.

            All treatments are performed on a heated stone
            massage table. Staying in a hammam will help relieve
            muscle tension and steam your skin so that subsequent
            steps are more effective.

            Masters use natural cosmetics. 
            Chocolate mousse will saturate cleansed
            skin with beneficial vitamins, and its aroma will 
            cheer you up.

            In the health center "Lotos Hammam" natural
            coffee is used for scrubbing, and in the Turkish
            bath "Hammam" peeling "Chocolate and marzipan with
            shea butter" is performed.
